Hi! So you've stumbled across this git repo and are most likely wondering how to use this thing. 

1.  Get your own API keys for spotify and youtube (redirect for spotify is 'http://localhost:5000/authorize')

2.  make a .env file with the appropiate file names and install the appropiate dependancies. 

2**.  Spotipy has some issues at the time of writing this and 'pip install git+https://github.com/plamere/spotipy.git --upgrade'
      will pull from their git repo the correct version rather than the incorrect version linked to pip install

3.  in the file containing the code, run 'flask run'

5.  make sure to get a PLAYLIST URL and not a VIDEO URL from Youtube. common mistake. 

6.  go to localhost 5000 and sign in via spotify

7.  profit. 



// I've been told that this service will likely be turned into something akin to what youtube-to-mp3 was back in the day but I've had this idea on my mind for far too long. 
// Also because my friend wanted to convert some playlists and I've kept them waiting for far too long. 

// There are more and better ones out there as I write this. But this one is special becuase its mine :)
